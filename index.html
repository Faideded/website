        <p class="paragraph1">I’m Oliver Betts, an aspiring UI/UX programmer with a long-time passion for creating digital experiences
        that feel clean, intuitive, and enjoyable to use. I’ve always been drawn to the space where design meets technology—where
        a smart layout or small interaction can make someone’s day a little easier.</p>
        <p class="paragraph1">I love digging into how people actually use products, spotting the moments where things feel confusing, and redesigning them into something smooth and satisfying. 
        Whether I’m sketching out interface ideas, experimenting with layouts, or refining interactions, I’m always aiming to create experiences that look great and feel right.</p>
        <p class="paragraph1">I continue to grow in UI/UX, I’m constantly learning, exploring new tools, and pushing myself to design with both clarity and personality. 
        My goal is to build interfaces that aren’t just functional, but memorable—interfaces that leave users thinking, “That was simple, and I enjoyed it.”</p>

        <p class="paragraph2" style="width: auto; height: auto;">For this project i was tasked with creating a blender scene for certain themes of work. 
            we were given a breif and told how to do the project and with what information needed to be displayed.
            For my theme i chose to do "Medieval" as it was something that i knew about before the project and had
            looking into in the past. Coming into this project i feel that i was unpreppared which is only due to 
            myself and my lack of time management. However i tried as hard as i could and it was a great project
            to start the course with and i feel that i got the best grade i could. Overall my Development diary was decent 
            with a little over 30 pages of A4 and 5,300 words with detailed pictures and explainations telling the reader
            exactly what they want to see.
