            <p class="paragraph2">For this project I was tasked with creating a blender scene for certain themes of work. 
            We were given a brief and told how to do the project and what information needed to be displayed. 
            For my theme I chose “Medieval”. Overall, my Development diary was decent with a little over 30 pages of A4 and 
            5,300 words with detailed pictures and explanations telling the reader exactly what they want to see. 
            <br><br>I was also tasked with producing some Concept art which i made 3 basic designs and one final design which i annotated accordingly.
